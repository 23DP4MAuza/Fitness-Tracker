## Logging Workouts
This feature allows users to log each of their workouts, including the type of exercise, reps and intensity. It helps users track their fitness routine over time, making it easier to review their progress and plan future workouts.

## Fitness goals
Users can set specific fitness goals (e.g., weight loss, strength building, endurance) to stay motivated and focused on their desired outcomes. The program will track progress towards these goals, helping users stay aligned with their fitness journey.

## Overtime progression
This tracks the improvement of a userâ€™s fitness level over time by comparing past performance data with current performance. It can show the increase in workout intensity, duration, or repetitions, helping users see tangible progress.

## Track calorie intake and burnt calories
This feature estimates the number of calories burned during each workout based on the activity type, duration, and intensity. It helps users monitor energy expenditure to align with their fitness and nutrition goals. Users can input their calorie intake to monitor their nutrition and compare it with calories burned during workouts. This helps maintain a balance between calories consumed and expended, essential for weight management and overall health.
